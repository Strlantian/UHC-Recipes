**UHC Recipes**
-

__*Introduction*__
- Recipes mainly from Hypixel UHC
- In order to be capable for survival, I changed some recipes
- Its only language is CN since I haven't finished the content of the plugin, so maybe I will do the localisation someday.

__*Author List*__
- STRlantian: Main Programmer ~~(im a noob lol)~~
- JoeMichaelQiao: Main Supporter and the Contributor of 2 recipes
- Attention: This plugin belongs to JMQStudio on pretense

__*What's More*__

Believe or not it's my first plugin.
It's still under development and has many unsolved problems.
I opened this repository to find if there is someone could offer me some advice or help.

You can try the releases, please use spigot server or above
in order not to make "NoSuchMethod" exception occur ~~(which just like wt*)~~
and then report me bugs and feedbacks. I'm gonna say thx for people doing this.

Well thx for helping or supporting me if you want.
